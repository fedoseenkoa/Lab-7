          [Verse 1: Brad Petering] <br>
          Are you sick of me? <br>
          Would you like to be? <br>
          I'm tryin' to tell you somethin' <br>
          Somethin' that I already said <br>
          You like a pretty boy <br>
          With a pretty voice <br>
          Who is tryin' to sell you somethin' <br>
          Somethin' that you already have <br> <br>
           
          [Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding] <br>
          But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right <br>
          She might let you stay, but just for the night <br>
          And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along <br>
          She might want a kiss before the end of the song <br>
          Because love can burn like a cigarette <br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          <br>
          [Verse 2: Brad Petering]<br>
          While the others talked<br>
          We were listenin' to Lover's Rock<br>
          In her bedroom<br>
          In her bedroom<br>
          And if you start to kiss<br>
          And the record skips<br>
          Flip it over<br>
          And sit a little closer<br>
          <br>
          [Chorus: Brad Petering, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]<br>
          But if you're too drunk to drive, and the music is right<br>
          She might let you stay, but just for the night<br>
          And if she grabs for your hand, and drags you along<br>
          She might want a kiss before the end of the song<br>
          Because love can burn like a cigarette<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          And leave you with nothin'<br>
          <br>
          [Dialogue: Lafitte & Constance]<br>
          Now, how many men have you kissed?<br>
          Very few<br>
          But you offered me a kiss. Why?<br>
          Such a foolish reason, I'm afraid. I just wanted to kiss you<br>
          <br>
          [Bridge: Brad Petering]<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du<br>
          <br>
          [Outro: Brad Petering, Faith Harding, Brad Petering & Faith Harding]<br>
          Because love can burn like a cigarette (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)<br>
          (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)<br>
          And leave you with nothin' (Du-du, du-du-du-du, du-du)<br>
          And leave you with nothin' (Du)

          [Verse 1]<br>
            Louise, she just wasn't thinking<br>
            When she climbed into his bed<br>
            She only wanted to lie beside him<br>
            To hell with his best friend<br>
            She woke him up and she whispered<br>
            But the answer wasn't good:<br>
            "Whatever made you think I would ever love you<br>
            Even if I could?"<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Louise (Louise)<br>
            You can't be anybody's friend<br>
            Louise (Louise)<br>
            I'll love you 'til I'm dead<br>
            Louise (Louise)<br>
            Not even if she likes the way you dance<br>
            Louise never heard about puppy love<br>
            'Cause they don't know that term in France<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2]<br>
            She came from across the country<br>
            Just to stare into her phone<br>
            She came to the same apartment<br>
            She only wanted to be left alone<br>
            And she could catch anybody's attention<br>
            But it never won her friends<br>
            Love could kick you out on the streets<br>
            But it never paid your rent<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus]<br>
            Louise (Louise)<br>
            You can't be anybody's friend<br>
            Louise (Louise)<br>
            I'll love you 'til I'm dead<br>
            Louise (Louise)<br>
            Not even if she likes the way you dance<br>
            Louise never heard about puppy love<br>

            She didn't even drive here<br>
            She couldn't have gotten very far<br>

            I didn't like her anyways<br>
            I only let her crawl into my arms<br>

            There was euphemisms and arrangements<br>
            There was alleged transgressions<br>
            She said, "I'm not very good at talking about this stuff<br>
            So nevermind"<br>
            She buried her face in the pillow<br>
            [Pre-Chorus]<br>
            What does it matter anyways?<br>
            She didn't like me anyways<br>
            I only thought because she climbed into my arms<br>
            But she wasn't trying to turn anyone on<br>
            She was only trying to stay warm<br>
